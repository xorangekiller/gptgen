    version 1.3
    * Added support for building on macOS. Thanks to Jan Kaiser!
    * Added support for getting the capacity of a non-sparse disk
      image on Unix-like platforms (Linux and macOS). This is
      an alternative to operating directly on a block device.
    * Added an integration test suite for automated testing.
    * Fixed writing the backup GPT header to disk. This bug
      only affected -w/--write mode.
    * Fixed building with modern CMake (>= 4.0), and bumped the
      minimum supported CMake version to CMake 3.15.
    * Fixed seeking in files to read/write blocks on Unix-like
      platforms (Linux and macOS). This does not affect Windows.
    * Fixed a memory leak writing a file with a backup of the MBR.

    version 1.2.1
    * Updated the Windows build instructions for newer versions of
      Visual Studio (with integrated CMake support), and rewrote the
      README in Markdown.
    * Fixed partition naming to be more useful (rather than just 36
      UTF-16 dagger (U+0x2020) characters like before). Thanks Phillip
      Hellewell for finding and fixing it!

    version 1.2
    * Added support for compiling with GCC 5 (on Linux and Windows)
      and Visual Studio (on Windows).
    * Converted the build system from hand-coded makefiles to CMake.
      This should be more flexible in generating project files for
      various IDEs.

    version 1.1
    * Added "-b" ("--backup") option for backing up the original MBR.
    * Added support for Acer/Lenovo recovery partitions (ID 0x12).
    * Fixed a crash in the argument parsing code.
    * The hidden status of Windows Recovery Environment partitions is
      now preserved correctly.
    * Added Code::Blocks support.
